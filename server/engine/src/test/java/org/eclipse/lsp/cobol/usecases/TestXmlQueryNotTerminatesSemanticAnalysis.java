/**
 * This test checks that an XML Query that has gaps in concatenation and variable calls with '$'
 * doesn't invalidate the position mapping. The reason of the issue was that {@link
 * CobolPreprocessorLexer} and {@link CobolLexer} produce different streams of tokens due to
 * different patterns for string literals and IDENTIFIER. The exact problem with the given code
 * example is that $PAYMENTDATE was treated as is by the {@link CobolPreprocessorLexer} and as $ and
 * PAYMENTDATE by {@link CobolLexer}, so the mapper while lookahead has been connecting the
 * positions incorrectly on the PAYMENTDATE below and ruining the trailing mapping. The string
 * literal had been parsed also incorrectly producing diverged token streams. As a result, the
 * semantic analyzer could not find a token for variable usages, producing unexpected behavior.
