/**
 * This value class is used to describe the position of syntax or semantic element in the workspace.
 * URI and range define the file in the workspace, and the position range inside it.
 *
 * <p>Copybook id points to a specific copybook entry this position belongs to. Used in raising the
 * syntax errors from copybooks to the COBOL file.
 *
 * <p>Token describes the element at the position. It is used while mapping the positions from the
 * extended document to the original ones.
 *
 * <p>Recognizer is a class where this positions extracted. Used for debug purposes.
 *
 * <p>Warning: LSP lines and position are 0-based, and ANTLR ones are 1-based. Keep it in mind while
 * creating a range for a locality.
