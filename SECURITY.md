# Security Policy

COBOL Language Support follows the Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy. Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the COBOL Language Support project lead. Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the COBOL Language Support project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team.

## Supported Versions

COBOL Language Support supports security updates only for the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the COBOL LS public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team directly via security@eclipse.org.
