### Licensing
The files in the this folder are a COBOL85 test suite by the National Computing Centre, UK, 
found originally at www.itl.nist.gov. The version here differs only in that it splits up the
 different programs in separate files, where the original puts them all in one big file. 
 The licensing is unclear, but the code is offered publicly at the above site.
