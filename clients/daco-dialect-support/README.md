# DaCo Dialect Support

DaCo Dialect Support is an add-on for the [COBOL Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.cobol-language-support) extension which enables language server protocol features for the DaCo dialect of COBOL, and support for MAID copybooks.

## Prerequisites

- COBOL Language Support extension
- Java version 8 or higher with the PATH variable correctly configured. For more information, see the [Java documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

## LSP Features

DaCo Dialect Support enables the following LSP features:
- Autocomplete for DaCo keywords
- Syntax and semantic check for DaCo keywords and variables
- Syntax highlighting and coloring for DaCo keywords and variables
- DaCo code snippets

## Copybook Support

DaCo Dialect Support enables copybook support features of the COBOL Language Support extension for copybooks named in `COPY MAID` statements. 

To enable copybook support, follow the instructions in the [COBOL Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.cobol-language-support) documentation. 

Specify paths to your IDMS copybooks in the IDMS Dialect Support extension settings as follows:
* Specify mainframe data sets under **Daco: Paths-dsn**
* Specify USS paths under **Daco: Paths-uss**
* Specify local paths under **Daco: Paths-local**

### Using Processor Groups

To use processor groups with MAID copybooks, add the `preprocessor` array to individual groups within your `proc_grps.json` file. 

#### Example
```
{
    "pgroups": [
        {
            "name": "GROUP1",
            "libs": [
                "LIB1", "LIB2"
            ],
             "preprocessor": [
                {
                    "name": "DaCo"
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
}
```

In the above example, the IDMS preprocessor is enabled on the processor group GROUP1. This enables the use of MAID copybooks with the programs linked to it in `pgm_conf.json`.
