COBOL Language Support for DaCo enables the following LSP features:
- Autocomplete for DaCo keywords
- Syntax and semantic check for DaCo keywords and variables
- Syntax highlighting and coloring for DaCo keywords and variables
- DaCo code snippets
    
## Copybook Support
    
COBOL Language Support for DaCo enables copybook support features of the COBOL Language Support extension for copybooks named in `COPY MAID` statements.
